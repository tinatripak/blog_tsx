# Blog website using React and TypeScript, inspired by Poise Wix's template
The blog will be deployed as soon as possible. It is written using the React library and TypeScript. It has three pages: a blog with posts, about, and a contact form. It is in a responsive design, I used SCSS modules for styles.

To run the auth page I need to run the "npm install" and "npm start" commands.
